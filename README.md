Introduction:
There is a LogIn page. After fill the fields and clicking on "Log In" button, the dashboad page appears, which is basically the assignment.
The Dashboard page is made up of different reusable components, which may or may not need props.

To apply further customisation to the desgin, the customStyles folder contains custom css, which is compiled using VsCode extension "Live Sass Compiler".
The class names for custom styles work, though they still need to be renamed properly.
